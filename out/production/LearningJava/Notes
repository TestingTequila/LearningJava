1: Variables: This is used to store anything
   How variables are created:
     -dataType variableName =value;

     -Data Type: Primitive Data Types [Know in advance how much memory will be consumed, We don't need object to use them]
        -byte [1 Byte = 8 bits][-128 to 127]
        -short
        -int
        -long
        ---------
        -float
        -double
        -char
        -boolean

        Non-Primitive Data Type: [Don't Know in advance how much memory will be consumed, We need object to use them]
           -Strings
           -Arrays

           PostIncrement/DecrementOperator: AssignAndThenIncrement/Decrement
           Ex: int a=10;
               int b = a++;
                So here at line number 22, first we will assign the value of a to b, and then we will increase the value of
                a by 1

                        int j = a++; //Post Increment [Assign and Increment] [denge aur for apna bhav badhayenge]
                        int t = ++a; //Pre  Increment [Increment and Assign] [pehle bhav badhayenge aur fir denge]

                        Statements: Decision making
                           -if statement
                           -multiple if statement
                           -if else statement
                           -if else if statement
                           -switch statement

                           ======================================
     if(condition)
     {
          agar condition true hai tabhi bracket k ander ka code execute hoga
     }

1. Variable + Method ---> within class
2. Variable -----> Private
3. not accessible in other
4. To make it accessible ---> create setter and getter method to assign value to private variable
5. Now we can apply rules over variable with the help of getter methods

1. private variable: setter/getter
2. private variable: constructor/getter
3. private variable: constructor/getter/setter

4. private methods encapsulated within public methods
